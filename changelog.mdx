<Update label="December 2024">
  This month we've had many exciting updates, including the launch of our Github Actions transparent cache, refreshed Ubicloud API reference, new project dashboard, and many more improvements.

  ## **Managed Github Runners**

  **Transparent caching for Ubicloud managed Github Actions**

  This feature improves your GitHub Actions cache and Docker caching performance by 4x, without changing the caching instructions. You can enable it by clicking a button on the Ubicloud UI.

  ## APIs

  **OpenAPI schema updated**

  We updated the OpenAPI schema to align with latest backend changes. Going forward, alignment between OpenAPI schema and backend is also now enforced, through the use of [committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee).



  **API reference updated with sample responses and interactive playground**

  See here for examples and the playground:

  **Personal access tokens can now be used for API authentication, with token-specific authorization on-top of account authorization**

  ## New project dashboard

  This redesign of our main dashboard in the Ubicloud console includes a more intuitive layout, allowing you to quickly view a summary of your project's resources at a glance. Additionally, we've added detailed "Getting Started" links to help you navigate your project with ease. ([PR #2381](https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/pull/2381))
