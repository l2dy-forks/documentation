<Update label="December 2024">
  This month we've had many exciting updates, including the launch of our Github Actions transparent cache, refreshed Ubicloud API reference, new project dashboard, and many more improvements.

  ## **Managed Github Runners**

  ### Transparent caching for Ubicloud managed Github Actions

  This feature improves your GitHub Actions cache and Docker caching performance by 4x, without changing the caching instructions. You can enable it by clicking a button on the Ubicloud UI.

  ## APIs

  ### Update OpenAPI schema

  We updated the OpenAPI schema to align with latest backend changes. Going forward, alignment between OpenAPI schema and backend is also now enforced, through the use of [committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee).

  ### Update API reference with sample responses and interactive playground

  See here for examples and the playground:

  ### Personal access tokens for API auth

  Personal access tokens can now be used for API authentication, with token-specific authorization on-top of account authorization

  ## New project dashboard

  This redesign of our main dashboard in the Ubicloud console includes a more intuitive layout, allowing you to quickly view a summary of your project's resources at a glance. Additionally, we've added detailed "Getting Started" links to help you navigate your project with ease. ([PR #2381](https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/pull/2381))

  ## **VMs and Networking**

  ### Add location-specific default subnets to make VM creation simpler.
