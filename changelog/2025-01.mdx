## AI inference endpoints (new)

You can now use our OpenAI compatible API endpoints through AI Inference on Ubicloud console. 

### 7 open source LLM and embedding models

* Ds-r1-qwen-32b (Text-generation) 

* llama-3-1-8b-it

* Llama-3-2-3b-it

* Llama-3-3-70b-it

* qwen-2-5-14b-it

* qwq-32b-preview

* E5-mistral-7b-it (Embedding)

Summary cards display each model's key properties in the console.

<Note> Models are priced between $0.10 - $0.60 per million tokens. </Note>

### Playground for testing models

## Managed PostgreSQL

### Reduced prices by 15-20%, as new hardware continues to improve price-performance

<Tip> Our standard-2 PostgreSQL instances are now below $50 / month. This cost is 4x lower than AWS RDS while also delivering more performance, with NVMe disks contributing to the speed. </Tip>

### Minimum disk size reduced from 128 GB to 64 GB

### Larger storage options introduced also in the US

<Note> For large storage options in PostgreSQL that exceed 16 TB, please contact us via support. </Note>

### Download PostgreSQL CA certs from Console

This makes it easier to verify certs via SSL for more secure connections.

### ParadeDB new images: v0.14.1

## Sign in with Google and Github

**You can now use your existing Google or Github accounts to login to Ubicloud.** Passwordless login is also enabled.

## Fine-grained access controls simplified

Ubicloud comes with granular access controls that can be assigned to each user, for different resources. These Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) can now be managed much more simply through the console.

### Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) managed via console

### Step-by-step guide to user and API access management

With major changes to how authorization is managed, we created a detailed documentation page, with example scenarios: [https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/security/authorization](https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/security/authorization)

### Granular access also extended to APIs via personal access tokens

With these changes, we also deprecated our prior JSON based policy editor in the console.


## Managed Github Actions Runners

### Transparent Cache enabled by default for all new customers

We launched this feature last month, and given its strong performance, now made it the default for all new accounts.

<Tip> Transparent cache can speed up runs by 4x, without making any changes to your Github Actions caches. </Tip>

### **Faster runner provisioning times via improved pools**

By optimizing the types of runners we pre-provision and keep ready for incoming jobs, we've cut down average runner provisioning times by a further 2+ seconds.

### Github Actions caches can now be accessible from all scopes of your Github Repos

This is not a common usage pattern, but can be helpful for certain projects.

<Note> This feature is behind a feature flag, please contact us at support@ to enable. </Note>

## VMs and Networking

### Simplified Load Balancer port mapping for private networking
Clients now just need to open up the private port for private subnet range.![](/2025-01-private-subnet-console.png)

### Load balancer stack (ipv4, ipv6 or dual) is selectable
This selection is available in both the UI and the API
